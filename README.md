# Dated Data
We want to make a program that asks us to add or retrieve data.
When we add a program, we want it to get stored into a dbm file so that we can call it chronologically from whenever we added it in the program, having the key for the dbm as the amount of entries in the dbm file.
When an entry gets retrieved, the user will have to input the order in which it was added, using the amount of entries in the dbm file as the natural number to choose.
When we store the entries, we want to store the number along with the date and time that we stored it in.
When we retrieve the entries, we want the entries to be retrieved showing what number was put in at the time and at what time that number was put it.
